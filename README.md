Deep Learning Tutorials
=========================

One of my roles as Lead Deep Learning Intern at Thermo Fisher Scientific was the development of tutorial sessions for the Software Engineering/Algorithms Development Team on the topic of deep learning, with a particular focus on implementation in the Keras framework. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository is a collection of all the demos held encompassing the following topics: 

- Multilayer Perceptrons (Fully-connected Neural Networks)
- Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Number of neurons per hidden layer
  - Activation Functions 
  - Batch Size
  - Number of Epochs
  - Regularization
  - Class Weighting
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Hand-Engineered Auxiliary Inputs
- Keras Sequential API
- Keras Functional API
- Tensorboard
  - Scalars Dashboard
  - Images Dashboard
  - Graphs Dashboard
  - Distributions Dashboard
  - Histograms Dashboard
  - Projector Dashboard
